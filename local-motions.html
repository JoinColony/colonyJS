    <h1>Colony SDK browser demo - local deployment - Motion workflow</h1>
    <p><b>First make sure that the <a href="https://colony.gitbook.io/colony-network/guides/deploying-colony-locally"
          target="_blank">Colony contracts are deployed locally</a> and the <a
          href="https://colony.gitbook.io/colony-network/guides/reputation-oracle-setup">Reputation Oracle is set
          up</a>.</b></p>
    <p>We'll be using wallet address <tt>0xb77D57F4959eAfA0339424b83FcFaf9c15407461</tt> to connect to the <b>locally
        deployed MetaColony</b>. This address was used to deploy the MetaColony locally and is the "owner" of it. Any
      transaction will automatically be signed as we have the private key hardcoded. No connection to MetaMask is
      needed.
    </p>
    <p><b>1) Let's connect to the ColonyNetwork first</b> <i style="color:red">Paste in the address from the
        `etherrouter-address.json` in the `colonyNetwork` directory</i></p>
    <p>This will also set up the Motions&Disputes extension in the MetaColony with testing settings as well as
      distribute
      an initial amount of reputation and CLNY to the two addresses we're using for this example:
      <tt>0xb77D57F4959eAfA0339424b83FcFaf9c15407461</tt> and <tt>0x9df24e73f40b2a911eb254a8825103723e13209c</tt>.
    </p>
    <input type="text" id="address" placeholder="EtherRouter address" />
    <button type="button" id="button_connect">Connect</button>
    <p><b>2) Now we install the <tt>VotingReputation</tt> extension and bootstrap some reputation</b> (you only need to
      do
      this <b>once</b> for this example)</p>
    <button type="button" id="button_bootstrap">Bootstrap</button>
    <p><b>3) Now we approve some of the CLNY of <tt>0xb77D57F4959eAfA0339424b83FcFaf9c15407461</tt> for the Colony and
        the
        <tt>VotingReputation</tt> staking, which will remove it from the user's wallet</b> (you only need to do this
      <b>once</b> for this example)
    </p>
    <button type="button" id="button_stake_clny">Approve funds for Colony</button>
    <p><b>4) Jump forward in time</b> - When we connected to the Colony above, the two addresses mentioned were awarded
      some reputation. It is awarded in cycles; in our case it's set to 1 hour. As we have full control over our local
      blockchain, Ganache allows us to travel to the future! Fasten your seatbelts, here we go <i
        style="color:red">(take
        a look at the console for the reputation oracle!)</i>!</p>
    <p><b>Instructions:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>i) Press the button</li>
      <li>ii) Wait for the message <pre>âœ… New reputation hash confirmed</pre> to appear in your console (reputation
        oracle)</li>
      <li>iii) Press the button <b>again</b></li>
      <li>iv) Wait for the above message <b>again</b></li>
      <li>v) Then go to the next step</li>
    </ul>
    <button type="button" id="button_jump">Goooooooo</button>
    <p>Note: We're using Ganache's <a
        href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/blob/develop/src/chains/ethereum/ethereum/RPC-METHODS.md#evm_increasetime"
        target="_blank">evm_increaseTime</a> and <a
        href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/blob/develop/src/chains/ethereum/ethereum/RPC-METHODS.md#evm_mine"
        target="_blank">evm_mine</a> methods to first increase the block time artificially by one hour and then force a
      block to mine. This will trigger the local reputation oracle/miner to award the pending reputation. We have to do
      that twice, if the reputation oracle was just started for the first time.</p>
    <p><b>5) Then, we create a motion to pay some CLNY to a third address:</b>
      <tt>0x27ff0c145e191c22c75cd123c679c3e1f58a4469</tt> (this will also incur reputation if the motion passes) <i
        style="color:red">(make it less than <b>100</b>!)</i>
    </p>
    <input type="number" max="100" id="payment_amount" placeholder="Motion payment amount" />
    <button type="button" id="button_create_motion">Create motion</button>
    <p><b>6) Next, we look at the motion more closely</b></p>
    <input type="text" id="motion_id" placeholder="Motion ID" />
    <button type="button" id="button_get_motion">Get motion</button>
    <p>You will see the domainId in which the motion was created, the altTarget (which is the OneTxPayment extension in
      this case, as we want to execute the `pay` function on it), the encoded action and the stakes remaining for
      activation.</p>
    <p><b>7) Okay, now we're ready to stake.</b> Feel free to stake any amount, then get the motion again and see how it
      goes up :)</p>
    <input type="number" required max="20" id="stake_amount" placeholder="Stake amount" />
    <button type="button" id="button_stake_yay">Stake for Yay</button>
    <button type="button" id="button_stake_nay">Stake for Nay</button>
    <p><b>8) We can also simulate voting.</b> For that, we activate both sides by staking the required amount on both
      sides from a single address. That usually won't happen in the wild (except if someone wants to force voting for
      some
      reason). Stake on both sides and then get the motion data to see if <tt>remainingYayStakes</tt> and
      <tt>remainingNayStakes</tt> are both <tt>0.0</tt>
    </p>
    <button type="button" id="button_vote_yay">Vote for Yay</button>
    <button type="button" id="button_vote_nay">Vote for Nay</button>
    <p><b>9) Reveal the vote</b> After the voting phase is over (<i style="color:red">you will need to wait ~6
        minutes</i>
      - we are forwarding time again for that), the votes can be revealed. Only if a vote is revealed it is counted and
      the voting reward is paid out</p>
    <button type="button" id="button_reveal">Reveal vote</button>
    <p><b>10) If the motion was successful, we can finalize it.</b> In our example we can only finalize it if we wait
      long
      enough (~6min - the time is forwarded again when you press the button) after staking was only activated for Yay or
      if we voted for Yay.</p>
    <button type="button" id="button_finalize">Finalize</button>
