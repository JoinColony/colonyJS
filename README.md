## Developing

To start development on any of the included libraries, make sure you have Node v16.x and [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) v8.x installed.

To install all required dependencies run `pnpm install` in the root directory of the repository.

You can run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` in the root directory (will build all packages) or in the individual package directories.
