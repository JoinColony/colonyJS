The `ColonyNetworkClient` is a standard interface for interactions with functions and events described in `IColonyNetwork.sol`.

These interactions are generally concerned with the colony network as a whole, rather than at the colony level. This includes operations like getting a count of all colonies on the network, querying for information about a parent skillId, or deposits/withdrawals of staked CLNY for use in the reputation system.

You can learn more about the solidity implementation from the [Colony Network Docs](/colonynetwork/docs-colony).

For interactions within a particular colony, see [the ColonyClient docs](/colonyjs/api-colonyclient/).
