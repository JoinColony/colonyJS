## colonyJS-contract-loader

This package exports an interface which is designed to be used for creating
an Ethereum smart contract loading mechanism; for example, a contract
loader might take a contract name as an argument, then look up some
definition of the contract, and return the address of the deployed contract
and its ABI definition.

## Installation

```
yarn add colonyJS-contract-loader
```
