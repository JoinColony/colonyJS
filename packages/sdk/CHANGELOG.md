# @colony/sdk

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 36f9df2: Calling `getBalance` on a Colony without specifying a `teamId` will now return the total balance of the specified token across the whole Colony (including not-yet-claimed funds)
- 3a87d0c: **`sdk`**

  - `getReputation` now returns reputation within a domain as a percentag of the whole reputation within the team
  - `getReputationPoints` can be used to get the previous behavior
  - Added an `initialize` function to the `VotingReputation` extension

- 029288c: This changes the way `colony-js` clients are typed. We retain only the types of the last 5 versions of the types, all older versions will go untyped. This will give us some breathing room, at least for the amount of extensions that we have now.

  Furthermore the most recent (upcoming) contract changes were included in ColonyJS.

  Some changes were made to fix builds.

- beb7608: Breaking: Change the transaction API to allow for just sending txns and not waiting for them to be mined

  This change adds the new Colony SDK transaction API. The following is now applicable for all transaction methods (motions and metatransactions included)

  ```ts
  // Send off the transaction and only wait for the transaction hash
  const [tx, mined] = await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).tx().send(); // you can call mined() later (will yield the same as the fn below)
  // Send off the transaction and wait for it to be mined. Gets receipt and event data
  const [eventData, receipt] = await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).tx().mined();
  // Same for metatransactions
  await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).metaTx().send();
  await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).metaTx().mined();
  await; // And motions
  await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).motion().send();
  await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).motion().mined();
  await; // And metatransaction motions
  await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).metaMotion().send();
  await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).metaMotion().mined();
  ```

  Furthermore one can now encode regular transactions and motions into raw strings:

  ```ts
  const encoded_str = await colony.oneTx.pay(/* args */).tx().encode();
  const encoded_motion_str = await colony.oneTx
    .pay(/* args */)
    .motion()
    .encode();
  ```

- d703cc6: All examples, docs and guides are now adjusted to the v2 API.
- c8f5f74: **`cross-fetch` was removed as a dependency.**

  Users of this library have to make sure that a fetch function exists in the global namespace (e.g. by using `node-fetch` and [adding it to the `globalThis`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#providing-global-access)).

  It also adds another build target for Colony SDK which is a minified bundle of the library

- 3a1251c: - Adjusted docs, examples and guides to v2
  - Event sources for the `EventManger` can now be hot-plugged and are not hardcoded anymore.

### Minor Changes

- e931d0e: - `event-metadata` package was removed and all its functionality went into the `events` package

  - `ColonyEventManager` was moved to the `events` package as well
  - `sdk/graph` was removed and will be added back at a later point

  - There is now a `getMotionResult` method to get the result of a finalizeable motion.

- 245fc59: Add support for `glwss4` contracts in Colony SDK. No API changes were necessary.
  Contractor was bumped to v1.0.1 of the `@colony/abis` package
  In `core`, a guard was added to prevent trying to get permission proofs without an address.
