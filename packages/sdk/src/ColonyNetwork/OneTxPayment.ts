 * ## `OneTxPayment` (One Transaction Payment)
 *
 * Ordinarily payments require more than one transaction, because the payment lifecycle requires more than one permissioned role.
 *
 * In some use cases, there might be a need for one authorized individual to be able to create, funds, and finalize a payment within a single transaction.
 *
 * The OneTxPayment extension adds this functionality by adding a makePayment function which requires the caller to have both Funding and administration ability within the domain of the payment.
 *
 * Extension therefore requires Administration and Funding roles to function.
 *
 * Note: if you deployed your Colony using the Dapp, the OneTxPayment extension is already installed for you
