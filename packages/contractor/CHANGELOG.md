# @colony/contractor

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 029288c: This changes the way `colony-js` clients are typed. We retain only the types of the last 5 versions of the types, all older versions will go untyped. This will give us some breathing room, at least for the amount of extensions that we have now.

  Furthermore the most recent (upcoming) contract changes were included in ColonyJS.

  Some changes were made to fix builds.

### Minor Changes

- 245fc59: Add support for `glwss4` contracts in Colony SDK. No API changes were necessary.
  Contractor was bumped to v1.0.1 of the `@colony/abis` package
  In `core`, a guard was added to prevent trying to get permission proofs without an address.
- 3439729: colony-js gets support for the latest colonyNetwork release hmwss.

### Patch Changes

- 542ffad: Adjust import/export statements to be compatible with ESM only within node.js
- 50eefa9: Improve compatibility between ESM package.json generation and changesets:
  - Use template file for package.json stub files (for changeset compatibility)
  - Add .js extensions also for type imports and exports
  - Add type entries to all package.json files
  - Rename all .js config files to .cjs
