# @colony/events

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e931d0e: - `event-metadata` package was removed and all its functionality went into the `events` package

  - `ColonyEventManager` was moved to the `events` package as well
  - `sdk/graph` was removed and will be added back at a later point

  - There is now a `getMotionResult` method to get the result of a finalizeable motion.

- 029288c: This changes the way `colony-js` clients are typed. We retain only the types of the last 5 versions of the types, all older versions will go untyped. This will give us some breathing room, at least for the amount of extensions that we have now.

  Furthermore the most recent (upcoming) contract changes were included in ColonyJS.

  Some changes were made to fix builds.

- c8f5f74: **`cross-fetch` was removed as a dependency.**

  Users of this library have to make sure that a fetch function exists in the global namespace (e.g. by using `node-fetch` and [adding it to the `globalThis`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#providing-global-access)).

  It also adds another build target for Colony SDK which is a minified bundle of the library

- 3439729: colony-js gets support for the latest colonyNetwork release hmwss.
