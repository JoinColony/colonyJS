# `@colony/events`

This package contains pre-compiled Colony event contract bindings. These bindings contain types and ABIs for all events for all contracts across all versions in the Colony Network. You could use them in conjunction with the [EventManager from Colony SDK](https://docs.colony.io/colonysdk/api/classes/ColonyEventManager):

```ts
import { providers } from 'ethers';
import { IColonyEvents__factory as ColonyEventsFactory } from '@colony/events';

import {
  type ColonyEvent,
  ColonyEventManager,
  ColonyRpcEndpoint,
  MetadataType,
} from '@colony/sdk';

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider(ColonyRpcEndpoint.ArbitrumOne);

const manager = new ColonyEventManager(provider);
const colonyEventSource = manager.createEventSource(ColonyEventsFactory);

// Filter all events that signal the creation of a new team within a Colony
const domainEvents = manager.createFilter(
    colonyEventSource,
    'DomainAdded(address,uint256)',
    colonyAddress,
);

manager.provider.on('block', async (no) => {
    const events = await manager.getMultiEvents(domainEvents);
    if (events.length) {
        console.log(events);
    }
});
```
