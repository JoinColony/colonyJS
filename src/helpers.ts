 *
 * Domains within a colony can be nested and all the permissions in a parent domain apply for all child domains.
 * Yet at the time of calling a domain-permissioned method the contracts are unaware of the parent domain
 * a certain user has the required permission in. So when we these methods are called we have to supply them
 * the id of the parent domain the user has the permission in (it could also be the very same domain id they
 * want to act in!). Furthermore for the contracts the unidirectional chain downwards we have to supply
 * the method wuth the index of the domains associated skill in its parents children array
 * (`childSkillIndex`, see [[`getChildIndex`]]).
 * The contracts are then able to verify the permissions (the role) claimed by the caller.
 *
 * tl;dr:
 *
 * * `permissionDomainId`: id of the parent domain of the required domain the user has the required permission in
 * * `childSkillIndex`: the child index for a domain inside its corresponding skills parent children array
 *
 * @param client Any ColonyClient
