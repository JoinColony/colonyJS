The `TokenLockingClient` is a standard interface for interactions with methods and events described in `ITokenLocking.sol`. These interactions are generally concerned token locking, such as locking and unlocking tokens.

See [Clients](/colonyjs/components-clients) for more information about initializing `TokenLockingClient`.

See [ContractClient](/colonyjs/api-contractclient) for more information about the `ContractClient` superclass.
