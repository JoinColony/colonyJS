[colonyJS](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyJS) is a library to help developers build with Colony. Using the colonyJS library, you can build applications and services that query and interact with the [colonyNetwork](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork) smart contracts through a simple and standard JavaScript interface.

## Get Started
