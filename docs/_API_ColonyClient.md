title: ColonyClient
section: API
order: 3
---

The `ColonyClient` class is a standard interface for interactions with the on-chain functions and events described in `IColony.sol`

These interactions are generally concerned with functions and events internal to a colony, such as creating a task, assigning a work rating, or moving funds between pots.

For functions and events that concern the colonyNetwork as a whole, refer to the [ColonyNetworkClient API](/colonyjs/api-colonynetworkclient/)

==TOC==

## Creating a new instance

You _could_ create a ColonyClient by using an adapter and a query: `new ColonyClient({ adapter, query })` and then `.init()` it but it is advised to ask the network client for a new instance:

```javascript
const colonyClient = await networkClient.getColonyClient({ key: 'My Colony' }); // This is already initialised
```
