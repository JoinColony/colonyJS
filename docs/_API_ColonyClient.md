The `ColonyClient` class is a standard interface for interactions with the methods and events described in both `IColony.sol` and `IMetaColony.sol`. These interactions are generally concerned with actions within a colony, such as adding a new domain, creating a task, moving funds between pots, and managing permissions.

See [Clients](/colonyjs/components-clients) for more information about initializing `ColonyClient`.

See [ContractClient](/colonyjs/api-contractclient) for more information about the `ContractClient` superclass.
