The `TokenClient` is a standard interface for interactions with methods and events described in `Token.sol`. These interactions are extended from the ERC20 and DSToken standard token interfaces and are generally concerned with managing the native token assigned to a colony. This includes operations such as minting tokens, burning tokens, and transferring tokens.

See [Clients](/colonyjs/components-clients) for more information about initializing `TokenClient`.

See [ContractClient](/colonyjs/api-contractclient) for more information about the `ContractClient` superclass.
