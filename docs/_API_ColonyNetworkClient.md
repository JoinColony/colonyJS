section: API
order: 2
---

The `ColonyNetworkClient` is a standard interface for interactions with methods and events described in `IColonyNetwork.sol`. These interactions are generally concerned with the colony network as a whole. This includes operations like getting a count of all colonies on the network, querying for information about a skill, or registering an ENS label for a user.

See [Clients](/colonyjs/components-clients) for more information about initializing `ColonyNetworkClient`.

See [ContractClient](/colonyjs/api-contractclient) for more information about the `ContractClient` superclass.
