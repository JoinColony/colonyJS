Important changes to a task within a colony must be approved by multiple "task roles". Most of the methods that modify a task require multiple signatures before the modification will take affect and the transaction will be executed. We achieve this process with something known as "multisgnature".

==TOC==

## Multisignature Example

An example of a task method that uses multisignature is `setTaskBrief`. In order for this transaction to be executed, we will need signatures from both the `MANAGER` and the `WORKER` assigned to the task. Let's walk through an example using `setTaskBrief`.

### Start Operation

First, we need to start the multisignature operation:

```js

const operation = await colonyClient.setTaskBrief.startOperation({
  taskId,
  specificationHash,
});

```

This method will return an instance of the multisgnature operation. We can determine which wallets need to sign the operation by checking the `requiredSignees` and `missingSignees` properties:

```js

console.log(operation.requiredSignees);
// -> ['0x123...', '0x987...'];
//    ^ Both of these addresses need to sign the operation...

console.log(operation.missingSignees);
// -> ['0x123...', '0x987...'];
//    ^ Both of these addresses have not signed the operation...

```

### Sign Operation

Assuming that we are the first missing signature and the `MANAGER` of the task, we can simply sign the operation using the `sign` method, which is included in the instance of the multisgnature operation:

```js

await operation.sign();

```

We can now check the operation again for the `requiredSignees` and `missingSignees`:

```js

console.log(operation.requiredSignees);
// -> ['0x123...', '0x987...'];
//    ^ Both of these addresses need to sign the operation...

console.log(operation.missingSignees);
// -> ['0x987...'];
//    ^ Only this address has not signed the operation...

```

### Export Operation

In order for the other wallet to sign it, we'll need to recreate the operation on another instance of your app.

First, we'll need to format the multisgnature operation as JSON:

```js

const operationJSON = operation.toJSON();

```

At this point, we'll need to store the operation somewhere so that we can restore it from another app instance.

### Restore Operation

We can retrieve the stored JSON and restore the operation with `restoreOperation`:

```js

const operation = await colonyClient.setTaskBrief.restoreOperation(operationJSON);

```

### Sign Operation (Second Signature)

Assuming that we are now the second missing signature, the `WORKER` of the task, we can sign the operation:

```js

await operation.sign();

```

We can now check the operation again for the `requiredSignees` and `missingSignees`:

```js

console.log(operation.requiredSignees);
// -> ['0x123...', '0x987...'];
//    ^ Both of these addresses need to sign the operation...

console.log(operation.missingSignees);
// -> [];
//    ^ The two required addresses have signed the operation...

```

### Send Transaction

Now we just need to send the transaction:

```js

await operation.send();

```

## Contract State Changes

It's important to understand that the contract data used to create signed messages in these operations is related to the contract state at a particular point in time. While the required signatures are being collected, there are at least two things can happen that might cause the operation to fail:

* The addresses assigned to the manager/worker/evaluator roles have changed.
* Another multsignature operation is successfully sent on the given contract, increasing the nonce value.

If one of the assigned roles for a task has changed, the new wallet will need to sign it and we no longer need the signature from the wallet that was previously assigned. If the nonce value changes, the operation will need to be signed again by both wallets.

The multisignature operation can refresh these values to help prevent sending a transaction that will fail.

```js

await operation.refresh();

```

This will update the nonce value if another multsignature operation was successfully sent before this operation was able to collect all the required signatures, preventing an error when attempting to send the transaction.
